# Enhanced GAT Model for Node Classification on Cora Dataset

This project showcases an improved implementation of a **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** for **node classification** on the **Cora citation dataset**, replacing the original **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** baseline that was provided by the instructor.

The goal was to go beyond the fixed-weight aggregation of GCN by introducing a dynamic, attention-based architecture with advanced regularization techniques to achieve higher accuracy, better generalization, and improved training stability.
